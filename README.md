# AbstracTV

AbstracTV is a streaming site that pulls 'abstract' videos from Vimeo using the [Vimeo API](https://developer.vimeo.com/api).
The mission is to create a service similar to [reddit.tv](http://reddit.tv/) such that users can watch a stream of videos which play automatically when the previous one ends, as well as being able to skip forward/backward and navigate videos.

The site is being built with Node.js, Express.js, Jade, jQuery and Bootstrap.
